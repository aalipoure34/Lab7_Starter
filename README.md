## Important Notes

- Citations: Obviously a marginal amount of the service worker code is actually mine. The vast majority belongs to the Google tutorial. Secondly, during a discussion about why GitHub Pages wasn't setting up the internal page URLs correctly, a friend of mine pointed me towards using `window.location.pathname` instead of what was posted in Slack (`window.location.origin`). (I already brought this up to Evan; he approved and I'm just putting it here for good practice). Lastly, through a lot of discussions with friends about what the Google tutorial is doing, we realized their way of activation for the `sw.js` file doesn't work.
