## A Few Important Notes

- Citations: Obviously a marginal amount of the service worker code is actually mine. The vast majority belongs to the Google tutorial. Secondly, during a discussion about why GitHub Pages wasn't setting up the internal page URLs correctly, a friend of mine pointed me towards using `window.location.pathname` instead of what was posted in Slack (`window.location.origin`). (I already brought this up to Evan; he approved and I'm just putting it here for good practice).
- Offline Functionality: This has been shaky to say the least with GitHub Pages. Again, I discussed this with Evan and he basically said that my implementation was sufficient for this lab's purposes (thanks again Evan for the help).
